# dap42-hardware

This is a design of the dap42 in KiCad v6 using the STM32F103C8, there is no technical reason for this design and this STM is overkill. The re-design only part availability reasons. This design is based on dap42 v2 and [dc37's dap42 v3 design](https://github.com/dc37/dap42-hardware).
