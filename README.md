# dap42-hardware

This is a design of the dap42 in KiCad v6 using the STM32F103C8, there is no technical reason for this design and this STM is overkill. The re-design only part availability reasons. This design is based on dap42 v2 and [dc37's dap42 v3 design](https://github.com/dc37/dap42-hardware). 

Please see the parent repo at [devanlai/dap42-hardware](https://github.com/devanlai/dap42-hardware) for details on the DAP42 project. 

This design primarily uses the [KiCad default libraries](https://gitlab.com/kicad/libraries) which are expected to be in the global library table. A few footprints not in the KiCad Libraries are included in dap42.pretty which is configured as a project specific library. 

Firmware for this version to follow.
